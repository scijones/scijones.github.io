Hey, I'm Steven J. Jones and I'm a grad student at the University of Michigan in John Laird's Soar Group.<br />
<br />
Most of my work amounts to adding subsymbolic mechanisms to the Soar Cognitive Architecture.<br />
<br />
I've implemented spreading activation, base-level inhibition, and a few other bits in Soar. The general
unifying focus is on implementing subsymbolic mechanisms which provide new functionality to agents by
making different types of knowledge more readily available.<br />
