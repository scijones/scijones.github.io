Hey, I'm Steven J. Jones and I'm a grad student at the University of Michigan in John Laird's Soar Group.

Most of my work amounts to adding subsymbolic mechanisms to the Soar Cognitive Architecture.

I've implemented spreading activation, base-level inhibition, and a few other bits in Soar. Recently, I've been 
focusing on implementation of event cognition functionality. My general underlying focus is on implementing 
subsymbolic mechanisms which provide new functionality to agents by making different types of knowledge more 
readily available.

## Publications

*Efficient computation of spreading activation using lazy evaluation*

*Architectural Mechanisms for Mitigating Uncertainty during Long-Term Declarative Knowledge Access*

*An Architecture Approach to Modeling the Remote Associates Test*

*Anticipatory Thinking in Cognitive Architectures with Event Cognition Mechanisms*

And, once upon a time, I thought I was going to be a physicist:

*Noise-induced nucleation in a bistable tunnel diode circuit*

*Phase diffusion in graphene-based Josephson junctions* - Honestly, I only did sample prep for this one.
